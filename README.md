## Introduction

Signal smoothening is essential in electronics to reduce noise and irregularities, enhancing signal clarity and enabling accurate data analysis. This project explores two key methods: tanh smoothing and quadratic smoothing, demonstrating their effectiveness and applications.

## Project Description

The project includes detailed explanations and practical examples of tanh smoothing and quadratic smoothing methods. It discusses their mathematical formulations, implementation in signal processing, and comparisons based on real-world applications.

### Key Concepts 

1. **Hyperbolic Tangent Smoothing**: Utilizes the hyperbolic tangent function to achieve smooth transitions in signal processing.
2. **Quadratic Smoothing**: Fits quadratic functions to segments of signals to capture nonlinear variations and smooth out irregularities.

## Applications

- Educational purposes for learning signal processing techniques.
- Enhancement of data analysis in scientific research and engineering.
- Prototyping and development of systems requiring accurate signal representation.

### Prerequisites

-MicroCap-12 (32 or 64bit version)

-Solid understanding of signals (mainly polynomials and hyperbolic tan)
